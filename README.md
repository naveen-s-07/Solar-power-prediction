# 🧾 3D Mesh Normalization, Quantization, and Reconstruction

## Project Overview
It demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for **3D mesh processing**, focusing on how different **normalization** and **quantization** techniques affect mesh reconstruction accuracy.  
It compares **Min–Max** and **Unit Sphere** normalization methods using metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

The workflow includes:
- Loading and preprocessing a 3D mesh file
- Normalizing vertex coordinates
- Applying quantization and dequantization
- Reconstructing the mesh
- Calculating error metrics
- Visualizing the original, normalized, quantized, and reconstructed meshes

## 🧩 Objectives
1. To understand and implement normalization techniques for 3D meshes.  
2. To apply uniform quantization and analyze reconstruction accuracy.  
3. To evaluate MSE and MAE errors for each normalization method.  
4. To visualize 3D meshes before and after reconstruction.  
5. To identify the normalization–quantization combination that minimizes information loss.
